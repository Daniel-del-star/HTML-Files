<h2>Why I love Soccer</h2>
<p>I love the opportunities that soccer provides, especially for our youth —health, self-esteem, friendships and most importantly, a passion for life. “It is more than a sport, it's a lifestyle.” The game is all about the players. It promotes freedom and creativity.</p>

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p> High physiological and psychological demands like fatigue, muscle damage, and mental toughness.</p>
